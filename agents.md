## Contributing Guidelines

### Branching (Gitflow)

- `main` — production-ready code
- `develop` — integration branch (merge feature branches here)
- Feature branches: `feature/<issue-identifier>-<short-description>` (e.g. `feature/APP-15-create-agents-md`)
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<short-description>`

Branch names **must** include the Linear issue identifier (e.g. `APP-15`).

### Commit Messages

All commits must start with a sequential commit number (starting at 1 for the first commit on a branch, incrementing with each subsequent commit) followed by the issue identifier, then a short description:

```
<commit-number> APP-XX: <short description>
```

Example (first commit on a branch for APP-15):

```
1 APP-15: create agents.md
```

### Pull Requests

- **Title format**: `[applegeese] <Title>` (e.g. `[applegeese] Create agents.md`)
- Reference the Linear issue in the PR description (e.g. `Fixes https://linear.app/applegeese/issue/APP-XX/...`)
- PRs should target `develop` unless it is a hotfix targeting `main`

## Code Style

- Indent with 4 spaces (as used throughout this project's HTML/CSS/JS)
- All pages share a consistent dark/light mode pattern driven by `prefers-color-scheme`
- Keep styles inline in each HTML file (no external stylesheet)
- Keep JavaScript inline in each HTML file (no external scripts)
